CIDmovie was designed by Dreycey Albin for the UW iGEM team. CIDmovie.mp4 can
be found on the google drive.

# Description

When the movie begins, the camera pans around a dimerization nanobody and
molecule X. An anchor nanobody is visible at the top of the screen. The
words "UW iGEM 2018" are displayed in prominent black letters. All three
molecules come together, with molecule X binding to the anchor nanobody and
then the dimerization nanobody.
